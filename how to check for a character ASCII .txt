vf: the most derived version of the function must be executed


pvf = hey base class you cannot have the implementation but the class inherits you must have  
  virtual void function() = 0;   else the object of the derived class will not be created!  == abstract class

as the class internal details would be hidden and only a pointer of that would be used, 


virtual == overriding

virtual distructor,  {The reason is that destructors (unlike other functions) are not actually ‘overridden’,
rather they are always called in the reverse order of the class derivation}


If the definition of the pure virtual destructor is not provided, then what function body will be called during object destruction?
{and how we get to know we have successfully called the distructors of derived class}

A virtual destructor is essential for proper cleanup of derived class objects when they are deleted through a base class pointer.
It ensures that the destructor of the derived class is called, followed by the destructor of the base class, avoiding resource leaks.


The term "polymorphic" in C++ refers to the ability of a single function, operator, or object to behave differently based on the context—specifically
